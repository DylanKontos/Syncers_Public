Syncers is a 3 year coding/game-dev project where Dylan Kontos, learnt the fundamentals of:
- Programming
- Game-development
- Linux
- API's
- Web Hosting
- Networking
- And everything/anything else a DIY multiplayer-game involves...

Alot of aspects used solutions. These include:

- FishNet (I was not writing my own netcode...)
- Unity (And obviously wasn't making my own game engine)
- Xsolla (Accounts/In-Game purchases, bit heavy for a DIY)
- Edgegap (For elastic server spinups in various regions)

Thanks!
